					<h3>What I have expereinced</h3>
					<p class="para">I have been using spidigo services for more than 3 years. At first It was providing good service as they were having less customers. At that time I still have problem of dead connection on weekends. But it was with all the providers at that time. After that I have moved to another city. I tried different ISPs there. I was amazed with the seamless services they provided. I have also used Internet services in other developing countries. So what I have found this is the worst experience of mine using spidigo.</p>

					<h3>What I have suffered with spidigo</h3>
					<p class="para">They mostly disconnect my internet on Friday. So when I register complain they take 2 working days to fix it. I had to live without internet through weekend. They don't have online portal to register complain nor a toll free number. You have to do a chargeable call to customer care wait in queue for 5-8 minutes. Sometimes the call disconnects while you are in the queue. When I go to new customer call queue I get quick connection to customer care. I mean what is this? It shows you are eagerly waiting for new customers to fool them. They never reply properly on support@spidigo.com do not ever try to resolve your issue on the site. After sometime I have moved to another city for job. My parents were still using their internet service. But whenever I come back in the city for my weekend or the holidays the same story repeats most of the time. After suffering all this I discontinued their services. But they requested too much saying they have installed new fiber cables everywhere. I gave another chance with a warning. But after 6 month I have moved back to Ahmedabad and this is still the worst Internet Service Provider. I went to their office for disconnection and I found I am not alone. Also they said they cannot refund me the amount for the remaining months. I mean they find a new way to irritate and torture their customer every time you think what worse they can do? SIGH!! So I finally decided to make this website to prevent every internet user from this evil service provider. They say they have thousands of customers. But I think they cannot handle even 20000 active connection with their infrastructure. There are better service providers in Ahmedabad, please try them not spidigo.</p>
